# First Principles Thinking Framework

An AI-powered problem-solving framework based on Elon Musk's systematic approach to breaking down complex challenges. This repository provides both documentation and a reusable Claude Code skill for interactive first principles analysis.

## Overview

This framework helps you:
- Strip away assumptions and identify fundamental truths
- Break complex problems into solvable components
- Find breakthrough solutions instead of incremental improvements
- Think in terms of leverage and 10x improvements
- Separate physics (fundamental constraints) from politics (negotiable constraints)

## Repository Contents

### Core Documentation

1. **elon_musk_thinking_framework.md** - The 15 core thinking prompts organized by cognitive approach
2. **first_principles_agent.md** - Complete AI agent implementation guide with interaction protocols
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Repository guidance for Claude Code integration

### Interactive Skill

**`.claude/skills/first-principles.md`** - Reusable Claude Code skill for interactive problem-solving sessions

## The 15 Thinking Prompts

**Analysis:** Physics-Based, Assumption Elimination, Fundamental Decomposition

**Design:** Constraint-Free Ideation, Brutal Prioritization

**Risk & Innovation:** Failure Analysis, Norm Rejection, Possibility Distinction, Breakthrough Minimalism

**Strategic:** Clean Slate, Hidden Constraints, Politics-Free, Speed-Driven (10x), Scalability

**Optimization:** Leverage Identification

## Installation

### For Claude Code Users

Install the skill globally to use it from any project:

```bash
# Copy the skill to your global Claude directory
cp .claude/skills/first-principles.md ~/.claude/skills/first-principles.md
```

Then invoke it anytime with:
```
/first-principles
```

### For Other AI Assistants

Use the agent system prompt from `first_principles_agent.md` to create a custom GPT, Claude project, or other AI assistant.

## Usage Examples

### Business Strategy
```
Problem: "How do I compete with established competitors?"
Prompts Applied: Physics-Based, Assumption Elimination, Norm Rejection
Result: Focus on customer needs, not competitor features; create new category
```

### Product Development
```
Problem: "How do we reduce manufacturing costs?"
Prompts Applied: Fundamental Decomposition, Clean Slate, Leverage
Result: Redesign for manufacturing; optimize costliest component
```

### Personal Productivity
```
Problem: "I don't have enough time to achieve my goals"
Prompts Applied: Brutal Prioritization, Possibility Distinction, Speed-Driven
Result: Cut 90% to find true priorities; identify force multipliers
```

## How It Works

### Interactive Session Flow

1. **Problem Intake** - Describe your challenge with context and constraints
2. **Framework Selection** - AI selects 3-5 most relevant prompts
3. **Systematic Analysis** - Each prompt applied with probing questions
4. **Synthesis** - Combine insights into fundamental truths
5. **Action Planning** - Concrete next steps with highest-leverage actions

### Automatic Adaptation

The framework automatically selects appropriate prompts based on:
- **Problem domain** (business, technical, personal)
- **Complexity level** (simple, moderate, complex)
- **User goals** (innovation, optimization, decision-making)

## When to Use

### ✅ Use First Principles Thinking When:
- Fundamental innovation required
- Industry norms are failing
- Breakthrough performance needed
- Complex problems with unclear solutions
- Resource constraints force creativity

### ❌ Use Analogical Thinking When:
- Proven solutions exist and work well
- Time constraints don't allow deep analysis
- Low-stakes decisions
- Incremental improvements sufficient

## Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
- Evidence over assumptions
- Physics over politics
- Simplicity over complexity
- Fundamentals over analogies

**Communication Style:**
- Challenge every assumption
- Question industry norms
- Separate impossible from feels-impossible
- Think in 10x terms, not 10% improvements
- Focus on highest-leverage actions
