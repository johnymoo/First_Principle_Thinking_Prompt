## Overview

This framework leverages Elon Musk's first principles thinking approach as AI prompts. It's designed to deconstruct challenges to their fundamental components and rebuild solutions from the ground up, thinking from physics and engineering principles rather than by analogy.

---

## The 15 Core Prompts

### 1. **Physics-Based Problem Solving**
**Prompt**: *"What are the physics of this problem?"*

**Purpose**: Strips issues to objective reality and identifies hard constraints.

**Example Application**:
> "I'm struggling to grow my newsletter. What are the physics of this problem?"
> AI reveals the hard constraints, the real forces, and the non-negotiable bottlenecks.

**Use When**: You need to separate emotional reactions from objective reality.

---

### 2. **Assumption Elimination**
**Prompt**: *"If I couldn't rely on existing assumptions, how would I solve this?"*

**Purpose**: Breaks mental autopilot patterns and challenges conventional wisdom.

**Use When**: You're stuck following industry standards without questioning them.

---

### 3. **Fundamental Decomposition**
**Prompt**: *"What are the problem's fundamental components?"*

**Purpose**: Breaks challenges into solvable atomic parts.

**Use When**: A problem seems overwhelming or too complex to approach.

---

### 4. **Constraint-Free Ideation**
**Prompt**: *"What would the optimal solution look like if cost didn't exist?"*

**Purpose**: Generates ideal versions before working backward to reality.

**Use When**: You need to establish the target before figuring out how to reach it.

---

### 5. **Brutal Prioritization**
**Prompt**: *"If I were forced to cut 90 percent of this, what would remain?"*

**Purpose**: Forces clarity through elimination and reveals the essential core.

**Use When**: You're overwhelmed with features, tasks, or complexity.

---

### 6. **Failure Analysis**
**Prompt**: *"If this failed completely, what would be the root cause?"*

**Purpose**: Predicts exact failure modes in advance (pre-mortem analysis).

**Use When**: Planning a launch, project, or major decision.

---

### 7. **Norm Rejection**
**Prompt**: *"What would a solution look like if I ignored industry norms?"*

**Purpose**: Bypasses conventional thinking patterns and enables innovation.

**Use When**: Industry best practices aren't delivering the results you need.

---

### 8. **Possibility Distinction**
**Prompt**: *"What part of this is actually impossible versus just feels impossible?"*

**Purpose**: Separates physics from fear, objective limits from psychological barriers.

**Use When**: You feel limited but can't articulate why.

---

### 9. **Breakthrough Minimalism**
**Prompt**: *"What is the minimum viable breakthrough?"*

**Purpose**: Identifies foundational leaps that unlock exponential growth.

**Use When**: You need to identify the smallest change with the biggest impact.

---

### 10. **Clean Slate Thinking**
**Prompt**: *"If I restarted this entire project today, what would I build?"*

**Purpose**: Reveals elegant versions hidden within accumulated complexity.

**Use When**: You're maintaining legacy systems or processes out of inertia.

---

### 11. **Hidden Constraint Discovery**
**Prompt**: *"What hidden constraints am I not questioning?"*

**Purpose**: Exposes self-imposed ceilings and invisible limitations.

**Use When**: Progress has stalled for unclear reasons.

---

### 12. **Politics-Free Analysis**
**Prompt**: *"How would I solve this if I only cared about physics, not politics?"*

**Purpose**: Provides uncompromised technical solutions before considering constraints.

**Use When**: Organizational politics are clouding technical judgment.

---

### 13. **Speed-Driven Redesign**
**Prompt**: *"If I had to achieve this 10 times faster, what would I do?"*

**Purpose**: Forces extreme creativity through artificial deadline constraints.

**Use When**: You need to break incremental thinking and find step-changes.

---

### 14. **Scalability Projection**
**Prompt**: *"What would this look like if it had to scale to millions?"*

**Purpose**: Identifies early failure points and scalability opportunities.

**Use When**: Designing systems, products, or processes meant to grow.

---

### 15. **Leverage Identification**
**Prompt**: *"Which part of this solution creates the most leverage?"*

**Purpose**: Reveals the multiplier effect component and highest-ROI actions.

**Use When**: You need to allocate limited resources for maximum impact.

---

## Master Integration Prompt

**Use this comprehensive prompt to engage all 15 thinking modes at once:**

> "Break my problem into fundamental truths, strip all assumptions, find the optimal solution, identify hidden constraints, and rebuild from first principles."

## How to Use This Framework

### For Individual Problem-Solving
1. State your problem clearly
2. Select 3-5 relevant prompts from the list above
3. Apply each prompt sequentially
4. Synthesize insights into a first-principles solution

### For AI-Assisted Analysis
Use any of these prompts with AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) by prefacing your problem with the specific prompt:

**Example**:
```
"Using the prompt 'What are the physics of this problem?', help me analyze:
[Your specific problem here]"
```

### For Team Decision-Making
1. Share the relevant prompts with your team
2. Have each person apply 2-3 prompts independently
3. Compare insights and identify patterns
4. Build consensus around first-principles findings

## Framework Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Evidence over assumptions**: Base decisions on verifiable truths
- **Physics over politics**: Technical reality trumps organizational constraints
- **Simplicity over complexity**: The simplest solution is often the best
- **Fundamentals over analogies**: Reason from basic principles, not comparisons

### When to Use First Principles Thinking
- ✅ Fundamental innovation required
- ✅ Industry norms are failing
- ✅ Breakthrough performance needed
- ✅ Complex problems with unclear solutions
- ✅ Resource constraints force creativity

### When NOT to Use (Use Analogical Thinking Instead)
- ❌ Proven solutions exist and work well
- ❌ Time constraints don't allow deep analysis
- ❌ Low-stakes decisions
- ❌ Incremental improvements sufficient

## Implementation Examples

### Startup Strategy
**Problem**: "How do I compete with established competitors?"

**Applied Prompts**:
1. "What are the physics of this problem?" → Customer needs, not competitor features
2. "If I couldn't rely on existing assumptions, how would I solve this?" → Question the entire business model
3. "What would a solution look like if I ignored industry norms?" → Create new category instead of competing

### Product Development
**Problem**: "How do we reduce manufacturing costs?"

**Applied Prompts**:
1. "What are the problem's fundamental components?" → Material, labor, overhead, waste
2. "If I restarted this entire project today, what would I build?" → Redesign for manufacturing
3. "Which part of this solution creates the most leverage?" → Focus on the costliest component

### Personal Productivity
**Problem**: "I don't have enough time to achieve my goals"

**Applied Prompts**:
1. "If I were forced to cut 90 percent of this, what would remain?" → Identify true priorities
2. "What part of this is actually impossible versus just feels impossible?" → Separate perception from reality
3. "If I had to achieve this 10 times faster, what would I do?" → Find force multipliers
